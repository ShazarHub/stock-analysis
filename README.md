In 2017, the code took about 1.445 secounds to run before we got our results.If you look at the data above almost all of the total daily volumes are in the positive percentage (green) except for "TERP"

in 2018, the code took 1.457 secound to run before we got out results. Compared to 2017's total daily volume results, almost every ticker was in the negative (red) except "ENPH" and "RUN"
The pros of refactering the code is making the code simpler.
